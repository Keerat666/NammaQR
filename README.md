# Namma QR

This is a React Native app called Namma QR, inspired by the popular transportation app Namma Yatri. Namma QR aims to revolutionize the way we book rides by introducing a unique feature that allows users to instantly book an auto ride by scanning a QR code. This feature is designed to eliminate the frustration of waiting for cabs and provide a seamless ride experience for both riders and customers.

## Features

- Instant Auto Booking: Users can simply walk towards the nearest auto, scan the QR code displayed inside, and start their ride immediately. This eliminates the waiting time typically associated with online cab bookings.
- Driver Toggle: Drivers have the option to toggle between regular ride requests and instant QR rides. This ensures that drivers who are willing to provide instant rides can cater to customers who prefer this feature.
- Backend Integration: The app includes a mocked backend using Express.js and MongoDB to handle the dynamic QR code generation for each auto. Each driver is assigned a unique ID embedded within the QR code, enabling seamless identification and authentication.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Built with React Native, the app ensures compatibility with both iOS and Android platforms, as well as the potential to expand to web-based functionality in the future.
